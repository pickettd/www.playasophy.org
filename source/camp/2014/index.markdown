The theme this year is Caravansery, which fits very well with our hookah lounge
theme. We're focused this year on improving the lounge decorations, drinks, and
overall experience. In addition, the Wonderdome has undergone some upgrades for
better night-time visuals!

We've been placed on the 3:00 Plaza, which has resulted in some unique
challenges with the layout. This year's camp will be narrower and deeper than
any previous years, and will be even higher traffic than our spot at the corner
of 4:00 & A was last year!
