This year will mark Playasophy Camp's 4th year at the burn!
In previous years, our camp has focused around intellectual talks and presentations, followed by topical discussion groups.
We've decided to change direction a bit and move towards more casual and organic discussion centered around an Arabian-themed hookah lounge.
This format fits more with the style of discussion which originally prompted us to found the camp, and the lounge should offer a more welcoming draw for passers-by than a more formal presentation does.
In addition, the fluid nature allows for a more varied set of topics and viewpoints, for maximal intellectual stimulation!

Here's a preview of what our camp will look like:
