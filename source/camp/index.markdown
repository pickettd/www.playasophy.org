Playasophy Camp has been to the burn since 2010.
The founders started in 2008, but took a couple burns to build up to a legitimate camp with a mission.
This page documents the years that the camp has been to the Burn!

## 2010
This was our first year as a real camp!
About 20 people, veterans and virgins alike joined us for this burn.

## 2011
In 2011, Playasophy grew to a staggering 41 members, including a large number of virgins.
Our infrastructure was tested to its limits as we worked to be able to support everyone.

## [2012](camp/2012)
Burning Man 2012 (Fertility 2.0) was a good year for Playasophy.
We were placed at 4:10 & Foxglove across from a camp that loved blasting karaoke at all hours.

## [2013](camp/2013)
This year we've moved away from talks and incorporated more organic discussions around a hookah lounge.
We'll serve cool drinks and snacks to our guests while we converse on a wide variety of topics.
