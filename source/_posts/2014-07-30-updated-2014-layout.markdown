Placement on the 3:00 Plaza brings several new challenges, one of which is
redoing the layout. The plot we were placed on is 200' deep - twice as long as
any previous year - but only 40' wide. As a result, our layout has undergone
quite a bit of revision to fit this new area.

The upshot is that the tent area may be a bit less open than before, but we'll
have plenty of parking room in the back of the plot. We'll also probably need to
re-arrange the shade cloth pieces to cover the new longer structure.

See the [2014 camp page](/camp/2014/) for the full layout.
