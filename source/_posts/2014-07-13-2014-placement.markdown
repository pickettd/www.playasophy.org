We’ve been placed! 

Last week was a blur of excitement. Our humble camp will call the 3 o’clock plaza home for a very dusty week. A major change from last year’s 4:00 and A address; we’ll all need to pitch in even more to give back to the Playa.

However, with this news comes more responsibility and anxiety. Planning is still under way, and we’re getting closer and closer to a functioning camp every day. 

Check back for more exciting updates soon :)
