As of 2012, Playasophy Camp has been to the Burn as a 'real' theme camp three times now.
I'm extremely proud of the way the camp has grown and matured over the years:
we have a solid infrastructure, a maturing organizational structure, and a great group of Burners making up the core membership.
However, one area where we've consistently (and almost comically) failed as a camp is having an online presence.
The camp website &mdash; or rather, lack thereof &mdash; has been an albatross around my neck in particular.

Originally hosted at [playasophers.org](http://www.playasophers.org/), we had a _very_ basic CMS and some rudimentary forums.
The site was hard to use and hard to maintain because no one understood it; something obviously had to change.
We've since moved to using [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/) for communication, resulting in the near-complete abandonment of the old site.
During the 2011 Burn, we decided to do something about the problem &mdash; after all, we had web developers, a designer, and some software engineers &mdash;
we could build our own site!
I registered [playasophy.org](http://www.playasophy.org/) and set up hosting and some basic software, ready to go!

Alas, despite our good intentions, actually creating the site was delayed time and time again until I eventually shut off the server and let the domain sit unhosted.
(This had some interesting consequences when I finally checked on the domain again &mdash; it was pointing to some Japanese website about bees... don't ask.)
This past Burn reinvigorated my motivation to at least put _something_ consistent up &mdash; how could we claim to be a real camp if we didn't even have a _website?_
The result: the site you see before you!

For those curious, the site is extremely basic &mdash; it uses [Octopress](http://octopress.org)
to compile a set of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files with some templates to produce static HTML content.
The result is simple, but extremely robust and easy to work with &mdash; something history has proven to be very important.
I'm looking forward to adding more information and content to the site, so stay tuned for future updates!

Greg
