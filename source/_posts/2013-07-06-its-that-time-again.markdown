Hello all!
It's rapidly becoming that special time of year again, when the reality of the approaching Burn settles into excited burners everywhere.
Here at Playasophy, we're working on pulling together another year as a placed camp.
In a departure from our previous burns, we've moved away from long intellectual talks and towards more casual organic discussion centered around an Arabian-style hookah lounge.
For more information about our plans, check out the [2013 page](/camp/2013).

Here's a shot of our planned layout:

The man burns in 56 days!
