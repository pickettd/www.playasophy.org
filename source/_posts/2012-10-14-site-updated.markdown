I just finished adding more information and updating the website!
Click around the navigation up top to see, but now there are roughly four sections to the site:

- [Blog content](/blog/archives), such as news posts like this one.
- Details about [each year](/camp) the camp has been to Burning Man.
- Resources and other useful information, like [packing lists](/info/packing-list).
- Information about the camp, such as the [charter](/about/charter) and how to [register for next year](/about/camping-with-us).

I'll continue making updates and filling in content, but in the meantime I give you Playasophy Camp, 2012:
